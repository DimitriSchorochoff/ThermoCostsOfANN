# Computation of thermodynamics costs, namely Landauer and Mismatch, of Keras artificial neural networks
This repository contains the code of my master thesis at UCLouvain. The library file thermoCostsANN.py provides functions to compute both the Landauer and Mismatch of some* artificial neural network from the library Keras.

*Only composed of reshape, dense, pooling and/or convolution layers.
## Packages required
To test the code present on this repository, the following packages are required:

- numpy 1.22.3
- tensorflow 2.9.1
- tensorflow.keras 2.9.0

Note that the versions proposed are the ones used for the software developpement and that other versions may or may not work.
